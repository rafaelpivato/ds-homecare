# Dead Simple Home Care

This is a proof-of-concept on how to use pure Ruby on Rails to build a dead
simple home care management system.

You should be able to add clients, create care plans and manage visits with
tasks accomplished during such visits.

## Not Included

You should not expect from this any multi-tenancy support nor user
authorization. Also, authentication is given based on full-trust, meaning you
only need to enter your name on your first access to the system.
